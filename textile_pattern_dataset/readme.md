The textile pattern dataset is a set of images that is labeled with the pattern that is printed on or woven into the textile of the object. The represented object can be a piece of textile (e.g. a sample or a piece of tissue), or a fashion object such as a dress. The fashion object can be photographed individually or in a context, e.g. as worn by a model in a fashion show. The dataset can be used to train image classification models that classify images of textiles or fashion objects by their pattern, but may also be applied to other subject areas (e.g. design).
